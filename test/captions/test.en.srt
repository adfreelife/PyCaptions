00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
<font color="white">It</font> seems a paradox, <font color="white">does it not</font>,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
that the image formed on the Retina should be inverted?

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
It is puzzling, why is it
we do not see things upside-down?

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:33,000
You have never heard the Theory,
then, that the Brain also is <font color="white">inverted</font>?

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
No indeed! What a beautiful fact!

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,600
But how is it proved?

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,600
Thus: what we call

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:55,000
the vertex of the Brain
is really its base

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and what we call its base
<i>is really its vertex,</i>

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
it is simply a question of nomenclature.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How truly delightful!
